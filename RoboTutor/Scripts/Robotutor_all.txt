# Slide 1.
{behavior|HelloEverybody}
Welcome everyone! \pau=500\ Good afternoon!
\pau=200\

{behavior|Intro}
My name is Robo Tutor. \pau=300\ Today I will be giving a lecture to you.

{behavior|HandOverLeft}
In this lecture I will present an introduction to robotics. 

{behavior|MeAndYouLeft}
I will mostly be explaining to you about myself, \pau=300\and my fellow NAO robots.

{behavior|SpreadBoth}
The goal is to give you a general overview about how we work.


# slide 2
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|FirstMe}
I will start with telling you a few basic things about robotics, and what kind of jobs we might be able to do for you.

{behavior|MeAndYouLeft}
Then I will use myself as an example to introduce common sensors, and effectors of a robot to you. 

{behavior|PushAside}
I will also say a few things about, how you can write programs for controlling my behavior.

{behavior|HandOverLeft}
Finally, I will introduce the robot tutor project, and how the scenario is created. 

{behavior|PointForward}
Throughout this presentation, I will ask you some quiz questions. So please pay attention.
\pau=300\

{behavior|HandOver}
You should all have a turning point clicker. \pau=300\ Please use this to answer the questions I present on the slides.



# Slide 3 robot family
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

# "is" should be emphasized
{behavior|Convince}
The word robot is de-rived from the slavonic word robotnik which means serf.
{behavior|First}
It was first used in a science fiction play in 1921. 
{behavior|Think}
So the origin of the word robot is a little more than 90 years old.
{behavior|Me}
Let me introduce you to some of the more well-known members of my robot family. 
{behavior|HandOverBoth}
I will show some more robot relatives of mine on the next slide.

\pau=500\
{behavior|Balance}
Manipulators are my most distant family members. They are physically anchored to their workplace. 
{behavior|PointUpRight}
At the top left you see a typical assembly robot, the KU-KA manipulator.
These robots are used to assemble many items, 
{behavior|FromAToB}
from cars,
\pau=500\ 
to computers.
{behavior|No}
{behavior|State}
They do not have much intelligence, they just do as they are told, in some sort of preprogrammed script.

\pau=500\
{behavior|HandOver}
On the left bottom, you see the doctor of the family, Da Vinci.
{behavior|ConvergeHands}
He works together with a human doctor or surgeon, to perform many difficult surgeries.
{behavior|Capisce}
DaVinci is a high precision robot, which makes surgeries a lot easier for doctors.

\pau=500\
{behavior|State}
Next to KU-KA, you see the Ze-bro robot developed at Delft University.
{behavior|WavyShape}
Ze-bro is a member of the family of mobile robots, and can move on rough terrain.
{behavior|Convince}
It is a very robust robot that can survive a fall of several meters.

\pau=500\
{behavior|PointFrontDown}
At the bottom, in the middle, you see a quadcopter, that is a flying member of the mobile robot family.
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
They are commonly used for surveillance.

\pau=500\
{behavior|ShowSideLeft}
To the right of Ze-bro you see Honda Asimo, my big brother.
Asimo is widely known for its abilities to walk up stairs, \pau=300\ jump,
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
and perform many jobs around the house.
{behavior|Balance}
He also appeared in the movie, Robot and Frank.
\pau=1000\

{behavior|SpreadLeft}
At the right bottom, you see a human sitting with a robot.
{behavior|Think}
Can you guess which is the robot? 
\pau=1000\
They look quite similar, even indistinguishable if they do not move.
\pau=1000\
{behavior|State}
Robots like this are called Geminoid robots.

\pau=500\
{behavior|ConvergeHands}
These are just some of the many examples of robots in every day life.



# Slide 4 why do you need robots
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
So originally, we are meant to serve you. But, for what tasks can you put us to good use?
{behavior|Motivate}
I probably should make a good case here to convince you, that I am worth the money.

{behavior|YouAndMe}
Unlike humans, we robots are not affected by fear, and we are able to help with dangerous tasks, that you would rather not.
{behavior|Propose}
Take for example the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. 
{behavior|PointUpRight}
As you can see at the top left, robots were used to clean up the nuclear waste.

{behavior|HandOver}
Unlike humans we robots also have no problem, performing repetitive tasks like boxing items,
{behavior|ConvergeHands}
and putting things together. For example, 
\pau=300\
{behavior|PointUpLeft}
you can see at the top right, all cars produced today are assembled by robots.
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
In many assembly line tasks, we robots have become more cost effective, than human workers. 

{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
We are also becoming very effective tools, for gathering information in domains, 
that are difficult or dangerous for people to access. 
{behavior|No}
Without robots, you would not have explored Mars!

And last but not least, we are also
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
becoming more and more able, to assist individuals in performing daily tasks.
{behavior|SpreadLeft}
For example, you can buy my relative called the Roomba, to vacuum clean your house. 
{behavior|Applaud}
It can even detect filthy areas that need more cleaning.



# slide 5 what is a robot
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|ConvergeHands}
Let's now try to define what a robot is.
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Me}
As you will have noticed I am a robot. Because I have \rmw=1\legs,  arms\rmw=0\
{behavior|ShowBody}
and a body that looks a bit like a human, \pau=500\I am a humanoid robot. 
Although we most of the time, 
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
all will agree on seeing a robot when we see one, providing a definition that we all agree on,
{behavior|No}
is not so easy.
\pau=1000\
{behavior|Capisce}
Russell and Norvig define robots as, "physical agents that perform tasks, by manipulating the physical world." 
To this end, robots are equipped with effectors and sensors.

{behavior|SpreadBoth}
One of the issues with a typical definition as this one, is that, some appliances that you might think, are not robots, technically are.

{behavior|Think}
Imagine, for example, your home thermostat. It is a physical agent, also has sensors and effectors, and manipulates temperature in the physical world.

{behavior|PressDown}
But a thermostat clearly is something very different, from a robot like me!
\pau=200\

{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
Up to now, there is no standard definition of robot that satisfies everyone, and many people have their own.



# Slide 6 How do we work
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|FirstMe}
From now on, I will take myself as a leading example, to explain to you in more detail 
{behavior|OneTheOther}
about robot sensors and effectors.
I will also tell you something about, creating a program to control me.
\pau=300\
{behavior|HandOverBoth}
I will give you an overview of the most common, and important aspects.



# slide 7 humanoid nao
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

{behavior|YouAndMe}
When you see a humanoid robot like me, you must be attracted by my elegant appearance.
{behavior|SmallBow}
But in fact, I am a programmable compact electromechanical system, equipped with sensors that capture states of my body, and the world around me.

\pau=400\
{behavior|ConvergeHands}
All information gathered by my sensors is then processed,
{behavior|MeLeft}
by my processors to decide what to do next.
{behavior|Capisce}
Based on this decision, I then use my effectors to manipulate objects, or just move my limbs.
{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
To this end, a Linux system was tailored for me, to manage the data from various sensors, and schedule the control of effectors.

A framework called Nao Qi, which is a modular architecture, was designed to enable developers to build customized modules.
\pau=300\
{behavior|Me}
One can also control me using SDK libraries. I will provide details later on.



# slide 10
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

{behavior|HandOverLeft}
There are two main methods for controlling me.

{behavior|State}
One approach is to add a module on my Linux system, which then can be executed after I boot up.

{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
The other approach is probably more convenient for developers. That is to control me from a remote computer, through Wi Fi or cables. 

{behavior|You}
As you may know, a typical desktop or laptop computer 
{behavior|Weigh}
has more computation power, than I have on board. Therefore, the execution of a complex algorithm
{behavior|Propose}
may take significantly more time on me, than on a separate computer. However, you also need to consider that, transmitting data
{behavior|FromAToB}
from me, \pau=500\ to a computer, also costs time. For example, images may cost 
{behavior|Capisce}
hundreds of milliseconds, before they are transferred to the computer.

Thus, you will always need to make
{behavior|Weigh}
a trade off between running a module on me, or on a computer.



# slide 11
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

# all 
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
All robots need some type of sensors to observe the world around them.
\pau=200\
{behavior|OneTheOther}
Some robots need more sensors than others.
\pau=200\
For example, the assembly robot of several slides ago, barely needs any sensors at all.
{behavior|SpreadLeft}
Humans however, already have more than 700 sensors.
{behavior|Tiny} 
in one square inch of skin.
\pau=500\
{behavior|PressDown}
It also depends on the task. A robotic vehicle that has to navigate, in a complex environment needs many sensors, as you can see on the right of the slide.



# slide 12
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

{behavior|YouAndMe}
On the slide you can see what kind of sensors I have myself. I have 98 sensors in total.
Most of these sensors I need to function properly.
{behavior|No}
Do not look down upon the tiny resistors. For example, I have 27 resistors that I use for detecting,
{behavior|OneTheOther}
both the current to the motors, and the battery. These current values 
{behavior|Capisce}
are also used to, estimate the temperature of my joints and battery.
{behavior|You}
Now, I will introduce the more complex ones, in more details to you.



# slide 13 
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

# joints position sensor
{behavior|ShowBiceps}
The position sensors are the most frequently used sensors inside my body. 
{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
They are used to detect the angles of the joint rotation.
The sensor detects the angular position of the permanent magnet.
{behavior|PointUpRight}
The top right picture illustrates a wheel, with two equally spaced magnets. The voltage from the sensor, will peak twice for each revolution.



# slide 14 pressure sensor
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

{behavior|State}
The force sensor utilizes a material, whose resistance changes, when a force or pressure is applied. I need them to check 
{behavior|PushAside}
whether my feet are positioned correctly. They can be used to determine, 
{behavior|Balance}
whether I am balanced when I move my legs, and whether I am falling down. 
This information is also used during the walk.
{behavior|SpreadLeft}
At least one foot, must maintain contact with the ground, otherwise I will stop walking.



# slide 15 tactile
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

# tactile
{behavior|ShowMicLeft}
There are tactile sensors on my head and hands, to detect if someone is touching me.
{behavior|Balance}
The bumpers on the front of my feet, act as collision sensors, to check if I bumped into something.



# slide 16
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

# inertial and gyro sensors
{behavior|Me}
I have inertial sensors that can track my position in real time based on the detected acceleration of my body. 

The gyro sensors provide me information about my orientation. 
{behavior|State}
Thus, I can determine my next step using this information.
Since these sensors are sensitive to acceleration, they are also used to detect whether I am falling down.



# slide 17 sonar
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

# sonar
{behavior|ShowChest}
{behavior|YouAndMe}
On my chest, I have two sets of sonar sensors to approximate the distance, between me and objects in front of me, and to roughly estimate the position of the objects, 
as you can see in the pictures, on the bottom of the slide.
{behavior|HandOver}
The sensor contains an emitter, which sends out the ultrasonic wave, and a receiver,
{behavior|Me}
which receives the ultrasonic wave, rebound from obstacles.



# slide 18 microphone
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

Like how you use your ears to listen,
{behavior|ShowMic}
I have 4 microphones located on my head to do the same. I can determine whether  
{behavior|OneTheOther}
the words I hear match the words I expect, and localize the sound source.
{behavior|HandOver}
As you can see the in the picture at the bottom, 
{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
the different distances that the sound waves need to travel, induce time differences of arrival, which are measured and used to compute the current position of the source.



# slide 19 camera
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\ 

# camera
{behavior|YouAndMe}
Similarly to how you use your eyes to see, I use two cameras which I can use to see you.

Although the resolution of 
{behavior|MeAndYou}
my eyes is much less than your eyes, I can still recognize many things, with the help of computer vision algorithms.

However, the field of view of my cameras 
{behavior|No}
does not overlap, so 3D vision algorithms cannot be applied to me directly.
 
{behavior|State}
Fortunately, my developers have invented a method for stereo vision, by using two images, 
{behavior|LookAround}
taken at different perspectives, by one of my cameras.
\pau=1000\

# photo
{behavior|First}
Now, I will take a photo of you, using the camera on my forehead, and put it on the slide, to show, how my camera works.

# head pose for taking a photo
{behavior|PhotoHeadPose}
It takes some time, to create the slide.
\pau=1000\

# Take a photo
{camera}
\pau=3000\

# head pose back
{behavior|StandHead}
Almost done.
\pau=2000\

{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|You}
You there, \pau=300\ you weren't sleeping, were you?
\pau=2000\

#=========================================================================================

\pau=500\
# initial standing pose
{behavior|StandHead}
\pau=3000\

# Slide 18 Overview
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
In the first part, I introduced some basic concepts of robots, and sensors.
{behavior|FirstMe}
Now I will talk about effectors, programming, and applications.



# slide 19 Processor
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|YouAndMe}
Sensors give you, and me, a lot of information about our surroundings, 
{behavior|State}
but we need to determine, what we do with this information. I think the rules that
{behavior|FromAToB} 
map input,
\pau=500\
to output, have been discussed previously during the course. 
{behavior|Propose}
In a robot, the hardware that does this mapping is called, the processing unit.
{behavior|Convince}
Processing units are helpful for determining states in the world, 
for example, my exact location and how I should navigate through a map,
{behavior|FromAToB}
to get from one point to another.
\pau=500\
{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
Processing units also help me understand, the images I receive from my cameras, to detect things like faces and objects nearby.
Or for example sensor fusion, which combines the input
{behavior|FromAToB}
from a gyroscope, accelerometer and compass, into a single and better orientation value. 
which helps me determine where I am, and how I am moving.



# slide 20 Effectors
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

When the processing unit has
{behavior|OneTheOther}
processed the input, a decision follows, which would usually mean.
{behavior|Clap}
I have to move parts of my body. This is done using effectors.
{behavior|Propose}
{behavior|Balance}
An effector is basically anything to manipulate our world, for example my arms, my legs, and my speakers, etcetera.
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
Let's have a short look at what I can actually do with effectors.



# Slide 21 Head
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|HandOver}
A head is probably, the most important part for humanoids. For me, despite that many important electronic components,
{behavior|ShowMic}
 are inside my head. its movements also help me 
{behavior|LookAround}
to track objects that interest me.
My gaze direction also indicates my attention.
Of course, head movements are essential to some gestures like
{behavior|Nod}
nodding and shaking head, and to dance.
The lights in my eyes are also useful, 
# show blue, red
{behavior|Twinkle}
for showing emotions.
\pau=2000\



# Slide 22 arms
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Me}
One of my important effectors, is my arm. 
{behavior|Capisce}
Although, I only have three fingers for each hand, I can still grab objects. 
{behavior|RotatingCapisce}
I can use my arms to make gestures, as well.
When I need to stand up, from a sitting posture, my arms also help me to support my body.
{behavior|Clap}
And, arms are necessary for entertainment like soccer, dance, and games.



# Slide 23 leg
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Propose}
Legs are a representative feature for biped robots like me. 

{behavior|LeanRight}
They support our body, enable us to stand, walk, and jump.

{behavior|Propose}
Legs have advantages in walking over complex terrains, where wheels can be easily stuck, 
{behavior|HandOver}
for example, ruins caused by disasters.

{behavior|Spread}
However, compared to wheels, it is not easy to control my move accurately. 
This is caused by the backlash of my joints, and the slippage of my feet.
{behavior|HandOver}
As you might notice, I have been already standing at 
{behavior|OneTheOther}
a different position, from where I started the lecture, although my leg movements were small.
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
As a result, it is difficult to control me to walk in a straight line.

{behavior|PushAsideLeft}
Legs are also important for entertainment.

Look at me! I am going to show you how I can stand on one leg, and, kick.

{behavior|Kick}
\pau=11000\

{behavior|StandHead}
\pau=500\

If my friends were here, 
{behavior|Applaud}
I could even play soccer or dance with them.
\pau=500\



# Slide 24 - ZMP Support Polygon
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Balance}
Balence is a key aspect to the locomotion of bi-ped robots.
{behavior|MeAndYou}
Let me introduce to you, some basic concepts of controlling my balance.

{behavior|Capisce}
The Zero Moment Point, Z M P, is the point on the robot feets, where the moments acting on the robot
{behavior|Weigh}
are balanced by an opposing moment from the ground. 
{behavior|State}
If the Z M P, is at the edge of the foot area, or beyond it, the foot will tip over, and likely fall. 


{behavior|HandOver}
To be simple, the support polygon of a robot is, the convex hull of the footprints on the ground.

{behavior|ConvergeHands}
Under zero acceleration conditions, to keep the Z M P within the foot area, the center of mass of the robot body, 
should be kept inside the support polygon,
{behavior|Capisce}
and if so, the robot will not rotate about the edges of the foot,
{behavior|ShowBody}
and will remain upright.
\pau=1000\



# Slide 25 - ZMP Support Polygon
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

In this slide, I will talk about balance during walking.
{behavior|Propose}
When I am walking, I select the next step very carefully.
to guarantee the Z M P of my body always inside the support polygon. 

Let me show you how I walk. Please look at me.
{behavior|Walk}

\pau=2000\

{behavior|Capisce}
As you can see, my steps are small, and unlike a human.
\pau=1500\

{behavior|HandOverLeft}
More sophisticated walking style requires more complex algorithms, to keep the Z M P inside the support polygon.
{behavior|ProposeLeft}
One method is to model the locomotion of each leg, as an inverted pendulum cart, since most of the mass, 
{behavior|ShowBody}
aggregates in my upper body.
\pau=800\
{behavior|Capisce}
A widely used model is linear inverted pendulum mode, which constrains the motion of my body to the X Y plane.
{behavior|ConvergeHands}
Achieving position control of legs while making sure that, the Z M P is inside the foot area,
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
is a whole research field on its own, so I will not provide further details in this lecture.

# summary
{behavior|Clap}
This is just what I can do with my effectors though, there are even robots that can juggle, or play ping pong.
{behavior|No}
but I can not react fast enough.
{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
As you see, motors are not the only effectors that exist, but for me and most robots,
{behavior|ShowBiceps}
they are the most important ones, as they are essential to the movements of my body.



# Slide 26 - DOF
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|YouAndMe}
Your arms and mine too, are limited by what we call degrees of freedom.
{behavior|Capisce}
A free object has six degrees of freedom, three for moving, and three for rotation.
{behavior|Convince}
A linkage, like my arm, is formed by several bars connected by joints.
{behavior|HandOverLeft}
Joitns reduce degrees of freedom, because the bars cannot move freely anymore. 
They can only rotate around the joints. Take your wrist for example.
{behavior|LRUD}
You can rotate it up and down, left and right, and twist it, giving it three degrees of freedom.
{behavior|No}
My arm has even less degrees of freedom, because only some joints can rotate around three axes.
{behavior|CapisceLeft}
Some of my joints, like the three fingers of my hand, are controlled 
{behavior|Tiny}
by only one motor, so it only has one degree of freedom.



# Slide 27  DOF of NAO arm 
{slide}
\pau=500\

{behavior|State}
Similarly, my arm has a total of 6 degrees of freedom.
\pau=1000\

# better words?
{behavior|ShowArmJointsOneByOne}
Since my shoulder, can pitch, and, roll. \pau=1500\ my elbow, can roll, \pau=500\ and yaw. \pau=1500\ my wrist, can only yaw. \pau=1200\ and I have told you my fingers only have one degree. 
\pau=500\



# Slide 28 Programming
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Clap}
Now we have seen what I can do, with my sensors and effectors, 
{behavior|Me}
let me give you a brief introduction to how you can program me.
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
Choregraphe is an excellent graph-flow based programming tool shipped with me. 
{behavior|FromAToB}
You can drag boxes from libraries, and connect them to create your projects, as you can see on the right of the slide.
{behavior|Propose}
This type of programming is also called visual programming.
{behavior|OneTheOther}
Sometimes, you may need to change the code behind the boxes, or create your own boxes.
{behavior|HandOver}
You can use Python to code these boxes. Projects can be executed on a computer, and on the robot.
{behavior|PointRight}
Sometimes, actions you create might cause me to fall down. 
It is therefore very useful that, there are also simulators available for a try-out.

  

# Slide 29 
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|PushAsideBoth}
A-P-I's to the A L modules, provided with Nao Qi framework, are available for customized applications.

{behavior|State}
This slide shows an example, of text to speech module.

{behavior|HandOver}
You can also use, various programming languages, including c plus plus, java,

# Slide 30
{slide}
\pau=500\

c sharp, and even matlab to create your applications. They are all supported by our SDK libraries now.
{behavior|Propose}
However, only c plus plus and python, are supported by the Linux system on the robot.



# Slide 31 Robotutor
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Me}
Finally, I will briefly introduce the Robo Tutor project. 
\pau=500\

{behavior|First}
Thanks to the script engine, that is part of my system,
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
many different scenarios can be designed for me to perform.

{behavior|YouAndMe}
Right now, I am a robot tutor, teaching you about robotics. However, I can also act in a theater, using the same system.

{behavior|Spread}
As you can see on the left bottom of the slide, the script is very intuitive.

{behavior|Propose}
With such a script, you can easily orchestrate my speech, actions, slide control, et cetera.
{behavior|SpreadBoth}
But don't forget, I also need behaviors that need to be created, 
{behavior|Weigh}
and synchronized with my speech, and the other actions that I perform. 
{behavior|ProposeLeft}
There are several concurrent threads, that need to be managed!

{behavior|OneTheOther}
Scripts can be stored both on a computer or in my system, 
{behavior|Me}
and I can act using a script in my system, 
{behavior|PushAside}
without another computer.

However, at least for now, a computer 
{behavior|Propose}
is required for the slides and quizzes. 
{behavior|Clap}
Thanks to the turning point technology, I can check,
{behavior|YouAndMe}
how well you understood the content I just taught, 
{behavior|HandOver}
and provide more explanation on things, that were not clear.

{behavior|State}
My voice can also be transferred to a computer, and amplified, using the classroom speakers.

{behavior|ShowBody}
I am still growing. More and more functions will be added to me.
{behavior|Applaud}
Plans are for me to interact more and, for example, answer open questions that students ask directly, using a question-answer system.
{behavior|YouAndMe}
If you are interested in this project, please contact my boss, Koen Hindriks.



# Last Slide 32
{behavior|Twinkle}
{slide}
\pau=1000\

{behavior|Spread}
Alright, that was all.

{behavior|Bow}
Thank you for your attention and I hope you enjoyed my lecture.
\pau=1500\
{behavior|HelloEverybody}
I will now let Junchao to continue with the lecture. Goodbye!
